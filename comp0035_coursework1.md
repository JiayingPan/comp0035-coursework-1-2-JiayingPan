### Report 1
What I did in the last week:

- Choose a data set: I chose open air quality as my data set, and think that my long-term task is to draw the change trend of air quality at different times to achieve data visualization to summarize the law and even predict the air quality at a certain time in the future.

- Select a methodology: In the short term, I need to choose the right model for my data set first. Although I have never been in contact with this field, by reading the literature of different process models, I have a general preference. Based on the large amount of data of open air quality, I should choose among data science methodologies. After consideration I would like to select CRISP-DM as my process model, it is cross-industry standard and can be implemented in any data science project, regardless of its domain or destination. In addition, it provides a high degree of flexibility and helps to improve hypotheses and data analysis methods in a regular manner during further iterations. It's also the most widely/commonly used life cycle which is prescriptive in defining a scientific methodology that spells out each individual step.This is just the conclusion I reached after preliminary study of different methodologies. The decision might change with the depth of my understanding of it.


What I plan to do in the next week:

- Write a problem statement: Next week my task is to define the business need of the project. I am expected to firstly start with define a problem and write a problem statement which should be clear and precise about who, what, where, when and why. Then is knowing who are we designing for and will become our users. 

- Find target audience: It will be useful to create a persona to describe our target audience. Lastly is to write questions which could be answered from the open air quality data set, and what problem it will solve. Finally, after thinking about what the data will solve and provide, as well as who will be interested and using my service, I am able to establish a web app facing to my users.


Issues blocking my progress (state ‘None’ if there are no issues):

- Make a decision among models: I think one of the things that hinders my progress is my lack of understanding of software engineering and its models, which leads me to spend a lot of time doing some reading to understand what I need to do at each step and the difference between different model choices. Even after selecting the model, I may only have a shallow understanding of the concept of the model, but I don’t know how to apply the concept of each step to the actual operation.



### Report 2
What I did in the last week:
- Write a problem statement: Based on the information provided in the second week and the examples given in the PBL this week, I completed the problem statement about my data set. Based on the information on the open air quality webpage I selected, I listed the'Who, What, Where, When and Why' for it. For example, OpenAQ is a online community that summarizes air quality data measured by various professional departments around the world, but it is hoped that the collected data can be seen by people or machines more commonly to raise their awareness of environment protection.

- Find target audience: In order to find the target audience, I created personas representing different types of users to find their needs and interests. For example, tourists may visit this webpage because they are concerned about the weather and air conditions of the destination, office workers may visit the webpage because they care about the air quality during their daily commuting, and environmentalists may track daily pollution emissions through the air quality index, etc.

- Write data science questions: According to the air quality at each moment, we can visualize the data and generate a graph to represent the trend of change. According to the information displayed by the icon, we can solve: 1. What time of day air pollution is the most serious and the possible causes 2. How much air quality index is we hope to maintain or pursue 3. What actions need to be taken to reduce pollution to achieve our expected air quality.


What I plan to do in the next week:
- Watch videos: watch the 3 videos on Moodle about the introduction to data ethics, preparation and exploration, UCL computer science ethics for secondary data use and how to prepare data before starting to manage the data preparation and exploration.

- Start coding: I will use python pandas to prepare my data set and start coding on python, and maybe do some additional research of how to program to achieve data visualization, including the installation of the matplotlib and relevant commands.


Issues blocking my progress (state ‘None’ if there are no issues):
None
